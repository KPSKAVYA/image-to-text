Image2Text: Digitalizing and Recognizing Text from Images using OCR
Project Description
Image2Text is an OCR-based application that converts printed and handwritten text in images into editable and searchable digital formats. Using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, the system processes images like scanned documents, photographs, and screenshots to extract text. The project aims to automate document digitization, enabling data accessibility, improved information retrieval, and document management across various sectors like education, healthcare, and business.

Technologies Used
Python
Tesseract OCR
OpenCV (for image processing)
Pillow (for image handling)
Git (for version control)
Flask (optional, if you have a web interface)
Features
Image uploading and preprocessing for better text recognition.
Text extraction from various image formats (e.g., .jpg, .png, .pdf).
Display extracted text or save it in multiple formats (text files, PDFs).
Handles different fonts, handwriting, and low-resolution images.
Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd repository-name
Install required dependencies: It's recommended to create a virtual environment first:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the project: You can run the OCR script or the web application if you're using Flask:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py  # or the script that starts your application
How to Use
Upload an image (it can be a scanned document, photo, or screenshot).
The system will process the image and extract the text.
You can view the extracted text or download it as a text file.
