# **Image2Text: Digitalizing and Recognizing Text from Images using OCR**

## **Project Description**
**Image2Text** is an OCR-based application that converts printed and handwritten text in images into editable and searchable digital formats. Using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, the system processes images such as scanned documents, photographs, and screenshots to extract text. The project aims to automate document digitization, improving data accessibility, information retrieval, and document management across various sectors like education, healthcare, and business.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python** (Core language for development)
- **Tesseract OCR** (For text extraction)
- **OpenCV** (For image processing)
- **Pillow** (For image handling)
- **Git** (For version control)
- **Flask** (Optional, for web interface)

## **Features**
- Image uploading and preprocessing for better text recognition.
- Text extraction from multiple image formats (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`).
- Display extracted text or save it in multiple formats (text files, PDFs).
- Handles a variety of image conditions including different fonts, handwriting, and low-resolution images.

## **How to Use**
Upload an image (it can be a scanned document, photo, or screenshot).
The system will process the image and extract the text.
View the extracted text or download it as a text file.
